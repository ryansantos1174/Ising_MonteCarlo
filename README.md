SInstructions:
- Run Ising.py to run through the simulation
- function.py contains the custom functions for the code
- To create your own model ( not the one found in dipoles.npy) set load to False.
- If you want to see the animation for the plots set plot=True.
- SideNote: If you do end up wanting to see the animation you need to probably remove the for-loop in line 29 and fix the indentation, otherwise it'll show like 100 animations.
